# Agent guide

Solana trading bot for pump.fun and letsbonk.fun. Snipes newly created tokens and exits on a configured strategy. See [README.md](README.md) for setup and configuration; this file covers what an agent needs that the code doesn't make obvious.

`AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file, so Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Windsurf all read the same guide.

## Ground rules

- **Never run a bot with real funds** except for one explicitly requested, bounded live test using wallet `9MFfWXdTmtWi9CdnduujpKGVP2gCgyjtyD9e2XC7wLCe` and `.state/configs/live-readiness.yaml`.
  The exception is valid only when all of the following hold:
  - `execution.expected_wallet` resolves to that exact address; use only `.state/wallets/live-readiness.secrets` and never the root `.env`.
  - Immediately before execution, `--status` shows no active, pending, unresolved, or reserved work and `--preflight` returns `"ready": true`.
  - Do not raise any configured amount, fee, retry, or session cap. Require `--authorize-live`.
  - Execute at most one buy and its configured bounded exit. Stop after closure or immediately on any failure, timeout, or unknown outcome; never continue to another token.
  - Afterward, stop the bot, restore `enabled: false`, and verify wallet balance plus durable status and ledger state.
  This exception applies to no other wallet.
- **Never** touch `.env` or print its contents. `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` is a live key.
- Don't commit anything from `logs/`.
- Test with a learning example before touching `src/`.

## Infrastructure and research continuity

- **Public on-chain data does not mean anonymous/free RPC.** A task named
  "public discovery" can and should use the configured authenticated node.

- **The user identifies the root `.env` as the existing RPC/Geyser settings
  source.** Do not mistake a missing provider-only projection for missing
  credentials or repeat credential-location searches. The prohibition on
  opening `.env` still applies. If the user explicitly supplies a separate copy
  such as `ENVFILE`, extract only allowlisted RPC/Geyser fields in an isolated
  process, never display/load wallet fields, and keep the sensitive copy ignored.
  Otherwise obtain an owner-created service-only projection; never ask for
  credentials in chat or a different provider.

- **Use the user's existing dedicated Chainstack Solana node and Yellowstone
  Geyser by default.** Its existence is user-confirmed, not a hypothesis to
  re-check. Geyser supplies discovery/account/slot updates; the dedicated RPC
  supplies state reads and unsigned simulations. Do not switch to anonymous
  providers, shop for services, or propose an upgrade without a concrete need
  and explicit user approval.
- **Geyser slot delivery does not guarantee RPC bank readiness.** Solana
  `-32016` means the requested minimum context slot has not been reached, not
  HTTP throttling or bad authentication. Keep the slot floor and current
  capture's retry/stop policy; do not respond by switching providers or claiming
  a native simulation ran when its preceding state read failed.
  The six-venue diagnostic now censors a bounded read's correlated `-32016`
  without retrying; later fresh updates may proceed. Public on-chain metadata
  URLs must not trigger credential rejection. Match configured service secrets
  instead, and keep provider error bodies out of retained evidence.
- **Service authentication is not wallet access.** Reuse the provider-only JSON
  interface (`rpc_url`, `geyser_endpoint`, `geyser_token`) in
  `learning-examples/token-lifecycles/simulate_geyser_cycles.py`. Never obtain it
  by opening the root `.env` or a wallet-secret file. Never print endpoint
  credentials, tokens, or raw transport errors that might echo them.
  `listen-new-tokens/listen_geyser.py` loads dotenv at import; do not launch it
  unchanged for a wallet-isolated diagnostic. Do not start `bot_runner` for
  read-only research.
  A bare `GEYSER_ENDPOINT` authority needs an `https://` prefix in that JSON
  projection; it is not missing or invalid service authentication.
- **Latency acquisition belongs on the bounded London cloud runner**
  (`chainstack-pumpfun`, `europe-west2`), not the development machine. Reuse the
  documented provider-only projection workflow; keep offline checks/replay
  local. Check the current resource state before reuse, since prior temporary
  Jobs and provider projections were cleaned up.
- Before continuing research, reconcile the user's latest instructions with
  existing code, configuration, and retained evidence. An old anonymous-only
  experiment is not the current infrastructure choice. Public-provider
  failures do not assess Chainstack readiness, and an old Chainstack refusal
  does not establish a current failure or its cause. Preserve historical
  captures/locks rather than rewriting them to match a new decision.
- Changing transport does **not** change the research question: retain every
  approved venue/program, sampling rule, commitment, accounting gate, freshness
  deadline, size/fee/request cap, and zero-retry/no-signing/no-submission boundary.
  Do not substitute Pump.fun creation events for the six-venue cycle study,
  historical winners for fresh discovery, or connectivity for economic proof.
- If service-only access is missing, finish reachable offline work and report
  the exact missing projection/access prerequisite once. Do not repeat failed
  probes, broaden credential access, or offer another public provider as a
  workaround. A continuation request is not permission to relax safety limits.

## Layout

```
src/            bot source — this dir is the import root (see below)
learning-examples/   standalone scripts; each runs on its own, no bot config
bots/           one YAML per bot instance
idl/            vendored Anchor IDLs
logs/           {bot_name}_{timestamp}.log
```

**Imports are rooted at `src/`, not at the repo.** `uv pip install -e .` puts
`src/` itself on `sys.path`, so it is `from core.client import SolanaClient` and
`from utils.logger import get_logger` — **not** `from src.core...`. Learning
examples are deliberately self-contained: they import siblings like `pump_v2`
and `tx_status` as top-level modules and mostly don't import from `src` at all.
Don't "fix" an example by rewiring it to import the bot.

Dependency layers, low to high — don't introduce an upward import:

`interfaces` → `utils` → `core` → `platforms` → `monitoring` → `trading` → `bot_runner`

`interfaces` is the leaf — it imports nothing internal, and `utils/idl_manager.py`
imports `interfaces.core`. `geyser` holds only generated stubs and likewise
imports nothing internal; `cleanup` sits on `core`/`utils` and is pulled in by
`trading`.

Platform differences are resolved through `interfaces/core.py` abstractions
(`AddressProvider`, curve manager, event parser, instruction builder) and a
registry in `platforms/__init__.py`. Listeners and the trader are
platform-agnostic (`Universal*`); anything platform-shaped belongs under
`platforms/<name>/`.

### Naming inside `learning-examples/`

- **Directories are kebab-case** (`bonding-curve-progress`, `listen-new-tokens`,
  `copy-trading`). A single-token product name stays one word (`pumpswap`).
- **Files are snake_case, verb first** — `fetch_price.py`, `decode_from_*.py`,
  `extract_blocksubscribe_transactions.py`, `verify_*.py`, `simulate_*.py`.
  Exceptions are the shared helper modules `pump_v2.py` and `tx_status.py`, which
  are libraries rather than runnable scripts.
- **RPC and service names are lowercased into one token**, never camelCase:
  `blocksubscribe`, `logsubscribe`, `programsubscribe`, `getaccountinfo`,
  `gettransaction`, `pumpportal`. So `decode_from_gettransaction.py`, not
  `decode_from_getTransaction.py`.
- Fixtures are `raw_<what>_from_<method>.json` next to the script that reads
  them, under the same rules.
- `simulate_*` and `verify_*` never move funds — that half of the naming is
  load-bearing and machine-checked. The inverse is **not** true: `live_*` is not
  the only prefix that spends. `manual_*` (including the `pumpswap/` and
  `letsbonk-buy-sell/` ones), `mint_and_buy*` and `cleanup_accounts.py` all
  submit real transactions. Read the module docstring before running anything
  that is not `simulate_*` or `verify_*`.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync                      # install runtime deps + the dev group (ruff)
uv pip install -e .          # editable install (required for the imports above)
pump_bot                     # run all enabled bots
uv run src/bot_runner.py     # same, without the console script
```

Lint and format **the files you touched**, not the whole tree:

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix <paths> && uv run ruff format <paths>
```

A bare `uv run ruff check` reports ~1700 pre-existing errors across the repo.
That is the known baseline, not something your change caused — don't try to fix
it wholesale, and don't read it as a failing build. Just don't add new ones in
the files you edit.

Ruff config lives in `pyproject.toml`: line length 88, double quotes, target
py311, `E501` ignored. Selected rule families include `ANN` (type annotations),
`S` (security), `BLE`/`TRY` (exceptions), `C90`/`PL` (complexity), `ERA` (no
commented-out code). Type-hint public functions, Google-style docstrings, and
`get_logger(__name__)` for logging.

Python 3.11+ (`requires-python = ">=3.11"`, matching ruff's target). Runtime
deps are declared in `[project.dependencies]`; `ruff` and `grpcio-tools` live in
`[dependency-groups] dev`, which `uv sync` installs by default. `grpcio-tools`
is protoc — needed only to regenerate the `geyser_pb2` stubs in
`src/geyser/generated/` from `src/geyser/proto/`, never at runtime. That is the
**only** copy: the geyser examples reach it by putting the repo root on
`sys.path` and importing `src.geyser.generated`. Don't add a second copy under
`learning-examples/` — the last one drifted out of sync with the protos.

### Verifying pump.fun v2 trade instructions

```bash
# Offline: cross-check buy_v2/sell_v2 account layouts, PDA/ATA derivations,
# instruction encoding and quote-asset config against idl/pump_fun_idl.json
uv run learning-examples/verify_v2_account_layout.py

# Mainnet, no funds moved: simulate buy_v2/sell_v2 for one coin, report CU
uv run learning-examples/simulate_v2_trades.py <MINT>

# Mainnet, no funds moved: run the bot's whole buy path against a fresh coin
uv run learning-examples/simulate_bot_buy_path.py
uv run learning-examples/simulate_bot_buy_path.py --no-extreme-fast
```

Run all three after any pump.fun program upgrade. The simulations report
`unitsConsumed`; use it to retune `get_buy_compute_unit_limit` /
`get_sell_compute_unit_limit` in `platforms/pumpfun/instruction_builder.py`.

### Verifying the listener-to-buy path (issue #170)

```bash
# Offline: bonding curve derived from the mint (payload bondingCurveKey not
# trusted), unreadable curve skips the buy instead of submitting with guessed
# accounts, curve+mint read in one slot-consistent batch
uv run learning-examples/verify_pumpportal_buy_path.py

# Offline: extreme_fast_mode stays at ZERO RPC calls between detection and
# submission for CreateEvent-sourced tokens; pumpportal still refreshes
uv run learning-examples/verify_extreme_fast_zero_rpc.py
```

Fast listeners (pumpportal especially, but geyser too) can announce a token
seconds before every node behind a load-balanced RPC endpoint can read its
accounts — two back-to-back reads on the same endpoint may be served from
nodes at different slots. `trade.curve_refresh_budget` (seconds, default 2.0)
bounds the pre-buy curve read in `extreme_fast_mode`; when it expires the token
is skipped, because a buy built from listener-guessed defaults reverts on-chain
with `NotAuthorized` (6000), `ConstraintSeeds` (2006) or, on letsbonk,
`AccountNotInitialized` (3012). The sell path deliberately keeps the opposite
fallback — proceed with cached values — since skipping a sell strands the
position.

The refresh is skipped entirely — extreme_fast_mode's zero-RPC contract —
when `TokenInfo.state_from_event` is set, i.e. the listener parsed the
**CreateEvent** (geyser/logs/blocks), which carries the canonical creator,
mayhem/cashback flags and quote_mint. Instruction `args.creator` is
user-supplied and post-2026-04-28 may differ from the canonical `BC.creator`
(PFEE PDA delegation), so instruction-parsed TokenInfo deliberately does
**not** set the flag; the geyser parser prefers `meta.log_messages` over
instruction decoding for exactly this reason. `trade.trust_create_event:
false` is the escape hatch back to always-refresh. PumpPortal payloads carry
none of these fields and always refresh. Related pitfall (fixed in #184): the
IDL instruction decoder used to reject `create_v2` transactions that omit the
trailing `is_cashback_enabled` OptionBool (a legal wire form), silently
dropping those coins from the instruction path. It now reports omitted
trailing option-typed args as unset — `verify_create_v2_optional_args.py`
machine-checks that, and that mandatory args still fail the decode. The
log/event path stays preferred for the canonical-creator reason above.

### Verifying transaction-status handling

```bash
# Offline: stub checks plus a scan that every example verifies meta.err
uv run learning-examples/verify_tx_status_checks.py

# Adds a mainnet replay of the reverted signatures from issue #175
uv run learning-examples/verify_tx_status_checks.py --live
```

`confirm_transaction` answers "did this land in a block?", never "did it
succeed". A landed transaction can have reverted, and RPC reports that only in
`meta.err`. Reporting success without reading it is issue #175: buys reverting
with `BuybackFeeRecipientMissing` (6062) printed as confirmed buys.

- Examples use `learning-examples/tx_status.py` — `confirm_and_assert` in place
  of a bare `confirm_transaction`, or `assert_transaction_succeeded` after one.
  The verifier above fails the build if a new example skips it.
- The bot uses `SolanaClient.confirm_transaction`, which folds `meta.err` into
  its return value. **Read the boolean** — discarding it is the same bug.
- `_get_transaction_result` must send `maxSupportedTransactionVersion: 0` or the
  RPC rejects every versioned (v0) transaction with `-32015`, and a good trade
  reads back as unconfirmed.
- `build_and_send_transaction` returns a solders `Signature`, not a `str`. A
  `Signature` is not JSON serializable and does not support slicing; a `str` is
  rejected by solana-py's `confirm_transaction`. Normalize at the boundary.
- `post_rpc` must catch `asyncio.TimeoutError` alongside `aiohttp.ClientError`.
  aiohttp raises the former when the request timeout fires and it is **not** a
  `ClientError`, so leaving it out lets every RPC timeout escape unretried —
  and `str()` on it is empty, so the caller logs a blank reason. A slow
  `getAccountInfo` is enough to take down a whole listener run this way.
- **Only `core.client.RpcUnavailableError` means "retry later".** `_read_rpc`
  raises it after transport exhaustion (cause preserved) and `post_rpc` returns
  `None` for the same condition; the pump fee schedule maps that `None` to
  `_FeeAttestationUnavailable`, a subclass. A permanent 4xx (anything but
  408/429), a 2xx with a non-JSON body, decode failures and an attestation
  mismatch are **not** transient and surface as `JsonRpcError`/`ValueError`/
  plain `_FeeAttestationError`. The position monitor rides out only
  `RpcUnavailableError` on its read-only price check, bounded by
  `trade.price_read_outage_budget`; a live DNS outage that raised a cause-less
  `_FeeAttestationError` used to kill the monitor and strand the position. The
  curve managers' `except Exception -> ValueError` wraps re-raise the typed
  error first — keep that ordering, and never widen the monitor's catch to
  `Exception`: a mismatch or a bad price must fail immediately.

- **A wire handed to TPU is never "never sent".** `build_and_send_transaction`
  QUIC/UDP-broadcasts to current leaders *before* the rate-limited HTTP send, so
  a cancellation, rate-limiter failure or HTTP preflight rejection can follow a
  real delivery. Only a wire no leader accepted may be released (and only then
  may `PreflightRejected` be raised, letting the caller rebuild a wire); after
  any delivery the signature stays reserved as `unknown` and callers reconcile
  by signature. Releasing a delivered wire deletes its risk reservation, so the
  next attempt signs a second buy/sell for the same intent under a session cap
  that no longer counts the first.
- **A prepared replay is bound to its risk session.** `risk_reservations` are
  immutable per signature (`record_submission` raises `LedgerConflict` if
  another session tries to claim one), and `_validate_prepared_replay_policy`
  refuses a wire whose `risk_session_id` differs from the authorized session or
  whose session already exceeds its caps. Restarting into a new `risk_session_id`
  must never silently transmit an old session's reserved wire.
- **Confirmed is not finalized.** Every stored outcome carries the commitment
  it was observed at, and `--status` lists `provisional_outcomes` beside
  `active_submissions` — a trade that landed on a supermajority vote but is not
  yet locked out can still be dropped by a fork. A finalized observation may
  supersede a weaker confirmation (promotion, or correction when the fork
  dropped it); a weaker one never overwrites a stronger. The unresolved-buy
  loop re-reads provisional signatures at `finalized` on its existing tick
  (no extra RPC), and a corrected buy releases the position that never received
  tokens while keeping the mint blocked. A correction arriving after the
  position was already released is logged for manual review, not auto-restored:
  the cleanup journal is not safely reversible.

### Verifying the tp/sl exit path (issue #189)

```bash
# Offline: the exit sell prices off the price that triggered it, a reverted
# exit sell is retried, and the retry is bounded
uv run learning-examples/verify_tp_sl_exit_price.py
```

`PlatformAwareSeller.execute` does not read a price — the `token_price` it is
handed **is** the slippage floor (`min_quote_output = amount * price *
(1 - slippage)`). So the caller owns the floor's correctness. A tp/sl exit fires
precisely because price left `entry_price`, so pricing the sell off the entry
sets a floor the pool cannot pay on a stop-loss and the sell reverts with 6003
`TooLittleSolReceived` — during the drop the stop-loss exists to escape. On a
take-profit the same mistake runs the other way and the floor protects nothing.
`_monitor_position_until_exit` already fetches `current_price` at the top of
each iteration, so passing it costs no extra RPC call; `_handle_time_based_exit`
genuinely has nothing fresher and keeps passing the buy price.

The seller's `max_retries` covers **transaction submission only**. An on-chain
revert comes back as `success=False` and is not retried there, so the retry has
to happen in the monitor loop, where the price is re-read first.
`trade.max_exit_sell_attempts` (default 3, validated to 1..100) bounds it so a
token that keeps reverting cannot pin the bot on one position, and the counter
resets if the price recovers out of the exit band. After the last attempt the
position is left open and unmonitored — logged loudly, since the tokens are
still held. Watch the `break`: before #189 it sat outside both branches of
`if sell_result.success:`, so a failed sell abandoned the position after a
single try while leaving `is_active=True`.

### Strategy research: read before proposing an entry rule

`learning-examples/token-lifecycles/README.md` records what was measured on
exact on-chain data (10k+ coins, 7 live trades, the Slinky21 corpus) and the
scripts to re-measure it. Short version: at retail latency and 0.01-0.1 SOL,
every window after the creation slot is negative out-of-sample — slots 1-10,
curve milestones, and post-graduation (which in Sep 2026 is a manufactured
dump: curve bought out in <=10 trades, 50-100 SOL sniped at pool creation,
pool drained within 25 min). Re-run `record_lifecycles.py` and the two
`summarize_*.py` scripts before believing a new signal; rank on one time
half and score on the other, and never count wallet `BwWK17cb…` (the System
Program) as a buyer. `src/monitoring/trade_flow.py` (entry gate, exit rules,
trade hub) and the `entry_gate`/`flow_exit` config sections exist and are
tested but are not a source of edge; leave them disabled unless new data says
otherwise.

### Listener and decoder pitfalls

Each of these was a live bug in `learning-examples/`, all of them invisible
offline and only visible after a couple of minutes against mainnet.

- **A `while True: recv()` loop must break out on `websockets.ConnectionClosed`.**
  Catching it in a broad `except Exception` that only logs makes the next `recv()`
  raise immediately, forever: `listen-new-tokens/compare_listeners.py` produced **13,090,862 error
  lines / 888 MB in 150 s** and never reached its own 30-second report. The outer
  reconnect handler with its `sleep` is unreachable in that shape. A narrow
  `except TimeoutError` or `except json.JSONDecodeError` is fine to swallow —
  those are per-message, not per-connection.
- **Resolve v0 lookup-table accounts before indexing them.** An instruction's
  account indices can point past `message.account_keys` into the address lookup
  table, which geyser reports in `meta.loaded_writable_addresses` then
  `loaded_readonly_addresses` (that order). Ignoring them crashed the geyser
  example with `IndexError` after ~11 coins in 150 s; resolving them removed the
  crash and brought its detection count level with the WebSocket listeners
  (35 coins each over the same window).
- **Identify an instruction by its 8-byte discriminator, never by account count.**
  Several pump.fun instructions share a count, so counting mislabels them and
  then prints every account under the wrong name — a real 19-account `create_v2`
  was reported as `claim_cashback`. Note `buy_exact_sol_in` is also 18 accounts
  on chain, same as legacy `buy`.
- **Walk `meta.innerInstructions`, not just `message.instructions`.** Most trades
  reach the program as a CPI from a router or aggregator: in 40 consecutive
  pump.fun transactions there was **1 top-level** pump instruction against
  **8 inner** ones. Anchor's event-CPI prefix (`e445a52e51cb9a1d`) accounts for a
  good share of the inner instructions; the event's own discriminator follows it.
- **`getProgramAccounts` over the whole pump program is rejected** by current
  providers: *"Too many accounts requested (10000001 pubkeys) … use
  getProgramAccountsV2 with pagination"*. It still works against pump-amm, which
  is small enough. Don't take that error message as a fix: `getProgramAccountsV2`
  is a provider extension (Helius, Solana Tracker), **not core Agave**, and its
  `limit` is a *scan* budget rather than a result count — a page can legally
  return zero accounts and a non-null `paginationKey`, so one filtered answer over
  the pump program costs ~1000 sequential pages. Reach for a filtered
  subscription instead; see the two `get_graduating_tokens*.py` examples.
- **Filtered `programSubscribe` on the pump program is the portable way to find
  curves by state.** `dataSize` + `memcmp` are applied server-side, and it is
  accepted even by the public `api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`. `memcmp` only matches
  exact bytes, so it cannot express "reserves below X" — only a handful of fixed
  cutoffs. Treat it as a bandwidth saver and do the real comparison client-side;
  don't assume a threshold is being enforced upstream. Geyser's account filters
  have the same shape and add the slot and signature.
- **Resolve a curve's mint under Token-2022, not SPL Token.** The curve account
  has no mint field and `["bonding-curve", mint]` is not reversible, so the mint
  comes from the associated bonding curve ATA — which is Token-2022 for every
  `create_v2` coin. `get_token_accounts_by_owner` with the SPL Token program
  returns an empty list for all of them, silently. Verified four for four on live
  curves, each confirmed by re-deriving the curve PDA from the recovered mint.
- **`SetLoadedAccountsDataSizeLimit` must stay generous: 16 MB, not 512 KB.**
  Verified by simulation on a Token-2022 mint with extensions — 512 KB and 4 MB
  both fail `MaxLoadedAccountsDataSizeExceeded` with `unitsConsumed=0` (never
  executed), while 16 MB reaches the buy instruction and is still 4x under the
  64 MB default. solders has no builder for it; encode `struct.pack("<BI", 4, n)`
  against the compute-budget program.

## Pump.fun protocol notes (gotchas)

The IDLs under `idl/` are vendored verbatim from `github.com/pump-fun/pump-public-docs`
(`idl/pump.json` → `pump_fun_idl.json`, `pump_amm.json` → `pump_swap_idl.json`,
`pump_fees.json`). Refresh them from upstream rather than hand-editing.

### Quote assets and the v2 trade instructions (current path)

- pump.fun supports quote assets other than SOL. `BondingCurve.quote_mint` is
  `Pubkey::default()` (all zeros) for SOL-paired coins; USDC
  (`EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`) is whitelisted in `Global`.
  **Legacy `buy`/`sell` cannot trade non-SOL-paired coins at all.**
- The bot uses **`buy_v2` (27 accounts)** and **`sell_v2` (26 accounts)**. Every
  account is mandatory and the order is identical for every coin — SOL or USDC
  paired, mayhem or not, cashback or not. `sell_v2` is `buy_v2` minus
  `global_volume_accumulator`. Layouts live in `_BUY_V2_ACCOUNTS` /
  `_SELL_V2_ACCOUNTS` in `platforms/pumpfun/instruction_builder.py` and are
  machine-checked against the IDL by `learning-examples/verify_v2_account_layout.py`.
- v2 args carry **no `track_volume` OptionBool** (24-byte data: discriminator +
  two u64). Volume tracking is unconditional now that `user_volume_accumulator`
  is mandatory. `max_sol_cost`/`min_sol_output` are in the **quote mint's** raw
  units — lamports for SOL, 1e-6 for USDC.
- Even for SOL-paired coins you must pass **wrapped SOL** as `quote_mint`, not
  `Pubkey::default()`. Transfers still happen in native SOL, and the
  `associated_quote_*` accounts are only seed-constrained — do **not** create the
  user's WSOL ATA, it would burn ~0.002 SOL of rent for nothing.
- Fee recipients: 24 total, in three sets of 8 (`NORMAL_FEE_RECIPIENTS`,
  `RESERVED_FEE_RECIPIENTS` for mayhem coins, `BUYBACK_FEE_RECIPIENTS`). Every
  v2 buy/sell needs a `fee_recipient` **and** a `buyback_fee_recipient`. The set
  is randomized per tx, per pump.fun's guidance on spreading program throughput.
- `sharing_config` (PDA `["sharing-config", base_mint]`) lives under the **pump
  fees program**, not the pump program. Easy to derive against the wrong program.

### BondingCurve account layout

- The account is **151 bytes**: 8-byte discriminator, then
  `virtual_token_reserves, virtual_quote_reserves, real_token_reserves,
  real_quote_reserves, token_total_supply` (u64 each), `complete` (1B, offset 48),
  `creator` (32B, offset 49), `is_mayhem_mode` (offset 81),
  `is_cashback_coin` (offset 82), `quote_mint` (32B, offset 83), then 36 reserved
  zero bytes. The documented struct is 115 bytes; the extra 36 are padding.
- The SOL-named fields were **renamed**: `virtual_sol_reserves` →
  `virtual_quote_reserves`, `real_sol_reserves` → `real_quote_reserves`. The
  curve manager still exposes the old names as aliases, so pre-existing callers
  keep working for SOL-paired coins — but anything doing arithmetic must scale by
  the quote mint's decimals (`quote_units_per_token`), not a hardcoded 1e9.
- PumpSwap `Pool` gained a trailing **`virtual_quote_reserves: i128`** (16 bytes,
  offset 245). Pool fields end at 261; live accounts are **301 bytes** with
  trailing padding. Quote against **effective** reserves:
  `pool_quote_token_account.amount + virtual_quote_reserves`.
  **Upstream's release note claims it is 0 on all pools — that is out of date.**
  Verified on mainnet: pool `6Bv1JM1deBPe…` carries 17.584505433 SOL of virtual
  reserves against a 148.455 SOL vault, so quoting off the raw vault balance
  under-prices by ~10.6%. It is `i128`, not `u64` — reading 8 bytes happens to
  work only while the high half is zero.
- pump-amm has **no** `buy_v2`/`sell_v2`. The AMM instruction names are
  unchanged; only the pool layout and quoting moved.

### Coin creation

- The IDL instruction is `create_v2` (snake_case). Args: `name (str),
  symbol (str), uri (str), creator (pubkey), is_mayhem_mode (bool),
  is_cashback_enabled (OptionBool 1B)`. `OptionBool` is a struct wrapping a single
  bool — serialized as 1 byte, not 2.
- **`is_cashback_enabled` can be absent from the wire entirely.** Two mainnet
  `create_v2` instructions carry `0001` and `00` after `creator`: one sends both
  trailing args, the other omits the last. A decoder that reads a fixed number of
  trailing bytes raises `IndexError` on roughly half of all coins. Decode
  trailing args defensively and report a missing one as unset —
  `utils/idl_parser.py` does this for trailing option-typed args since #184
  (`uv run learning-examples/verify_create_v2_optional_args.py` checks it).
- `create_v2` accounts 1-16 are in the IDL; accounts **17-19 are optional
  remaining accounts** (`quote_mint`, `associated_quote_bonding_curve`,
  `quote_token_program`). All three or none. This is the only way to read a new
  coin's quote asset from the instruction rather than the event. In practice they
  are appended for **SOL-paired coins too**, carrying wrapped SOL — a live
  SOL-paired `create_v2` was observed with 19 accounts and account 17 = WSOL — so
  do not treat a 19-account `create_v2` as proof of a non-SOL quote asset. Read
  `quote_mint` off the curve instead.
- The **associated bonding curve is an ordinary ATA**, so its address depends on
  which token program owns the mint: Token2022 for `create_v2` coins, SPL Token
  for legacy `create`. Deriving with the wrong program returns a valid-looking
  address that does not exist on chain. Verified: curve `3jJ83ND…` derives to
  `Cd4iC3Jn…` under Token2022 (matches chain) and `AhNzZsBp…` under SPL Token.
- `extreme_fast_mode` skips the curve-state price fetch. Whether it also reads
  the curve for mayhem/cashback/creator/**quote_mint** depends on provenance
  (see "Verifying the listener-to-buy path" above): CreateEvent-sourced tokens
  (`state_from_event`) trade on the event data with zero RPC calls, while
  pumpportal/incomplete-event tokens refresh from chain — the wrong quote mint
  means spending the wrong balance entirely. Event parsers populate
  `quote_mint` from `CreateEvent` (which gained `quote_mint` and
  `virtual_quote_reserves` as trailing fields).

### Legacy instructions (fallback only)

Retained behind `PumpFunInstructionBuilder(..., use_legacy_instructions=True)`.
The IDL under-reports these: `buy` is **18 accounts** on-chain (IDL lists 16) and
`sell` is **16 non-cashback / 17 cashback** (IDL lists 14). The extras are
`bonding-curve-v2` (PDA `["bonding-curve-v2", mint]`) followed by a buyback fee
recipient (mutable); the cashback sell path also inserts
`user_volume_accumulator` before `bonding-curve-v2`. On the PumpSwap side the
legacy path needs `pool-v2` (PDA `["pool-v2", base_mint]` under pump-amm) —
without it pump-amm throws `AnchorError 6023 (Overflow)` after the transfers
complete, a misleading code for a missing account. Prefer v2 — it is the
interface pump.fun maintains.

## Config notes

- Bot YAML supports `${VAR}` interpolation from the file named by `env_file`.
  Actual variable names are `SOLANA_NODE_RPC_ENDPOINT`,
  `SOLANA_NODE_WSS_ENDPOINT`, `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GEYSER_*`.
- `config_loader.py` validates the platform/listener pairing before startup:
  pump.fun supports `logs`, `blocks`, `geyser`, `pumpportal`; letsbonk.fun
  supports `blocks`, `geyser`, `pumpportal` — **not `logs`**. Adding a listener
  means updating `PLATFORM_LISTENER_COMPATIBILITY` there too.
- Bots with `separate_process: true` run in their own process. One log file per
  bot instance.
- **Quote caps are per quote asset.** `execution.max_trade_quote_raw` and
  `execution.max_session_quote_raw` accept either one integer (the cap for
  every quote asset, unchanged meaning) or a mapping keyed by `sol`, `usdc`
  or a raw mint: `{"sol": 10000000, "usdc": 5000}`. SOL has 9 decimals and
  USDC 6, so one raw number cannot express "0.01 SOL per trade, 5 USDC per
  trade" — and a mapping that does not name an asset **blocks** it rather than
  leaving it uncapped. Fee caps stay scalar: lamports have one scale.
- **Durable state is anchored to the project root, not the working directory.**
  Every ledger, position journal, cleanup journal, lesson DB and UI config
  path resolves through `utils.paths.state_path()` (`.state` under the
  project root). Launching the same wallet from another directory used to
  open a second ledger, position journal and cleanup journal: each instance
  then reported empty session totals and could submit while believing it was
  alone. Tests isolate state by patching `utils.paths.STATE_DIR`.
